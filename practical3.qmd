# Practical 3 {.unnumbered}

# Further data visualisation and manipulation with tidyverse {.unnumbered}

## Aim

The aim of this practical is to build on practical 2 and explore further how we can visualize and perform different operations on our dataset to support our data analysis.

## Objectives

During this practical you will learn:

-   sort data
-   summarise data
-   plotting single continuous variable plots
-   grouping data
-   facetting
-   customising plots
-   write data to files

## Instructions

The best way to do this practical is to read the Practical Notes which will introduce the concepts of this practical. These notes are designed with all the details you would need to be able to perform the exercises in this practical. In general, you would not need to refer to additional texts and resources as these notes have been explained in detail. Apart from the exercises listed below, there are also examples throughout the notes which provide insight on the concepts introduced, and therefore, it is recommended that you also run these examples as you progress through the practical notes.

**If you are an experienced R programmer**, you might find that you already know about the content in these notes. You may want to skip sections of notes that you already know and attempt the exercises that are at the higher levels.

### Exercises levels

Exercises in this practical are labelled with the level of difficulty of the respective exercise:

| Level                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![](images/stars-level-1.png) | **Level 1**: Exercises in Level 1 are simple exercises designed to get you familiar with the R syntax. If you already know how to program in R, you may skip these exercises. |
| ![](images/stars-level-2.png) | **Level 2**: Exercises in Level 2 combine different R programming concepts to solve simple problems.                                                                          |
| ![](images/stars-level-3.png) | **Level 3**: Exercises in Level 3 solve more complex problems.                                                                                                                |

### Exercises

This practical is composed of the following exercises:

| Exercise                                  | Description                                                                                                     | Level                         |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| [Exercise 11](tidyverse2.qmd#exercise-11) | **count() and arrange()**: In this exercise we will practice sorting and extracting the frequency of variables. | ![](images/stars-level-2.png) |
| [Exercise 12](tidyverse2.qmd#exercise-12) | **Frequency polygon plot**: In this exercise we will plot a frequency polygon .                                 | ![](images/stars-level-1.png) |
| [Exercise 13](tidyverse2.qmd#exercise-13) | **Group and summarise data**: This exercise will group and summarise a dataset .                                | ![](images/stars-level-3.png) |
| [Exercise 14](tidyverse2.qmd#exercise-14) | **Facetting**: In this exercise we will practice facetting.                                                     | ![](images/stars-level-2.png) |
| [Exercise 15](tidyverse2.qmd#exercise-15) | **Facetting and more**: In this exercise use the facetting with the different data summary stats functions.     | ![](images/stars-level-3.png) |
